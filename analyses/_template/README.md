# Analysis Template

Use this folder shape for new modeling, validation, and figure workflows. Copy the structure, rename the analysis folder with a short lowercase ID, and delete optional folders that are not needed.

Put each retained figure under `figures/<figure_id>/`. Hand-curated or digitized inputs go under `figures/<figure_id>/input/`. Generated model tables, plotted CSV snapshots, rendered SVG/PNG/PDF figures, and provenance files go under `figures/<figure_id>/output/`. Disposable figure-local runs go under `figures/<figure_id>/output/runs/`. Register MPLGallery-discoverable Matplotlib SVGs through the project root `.mplgallery/manifest.yaml`; do not require per-figure registration files.
