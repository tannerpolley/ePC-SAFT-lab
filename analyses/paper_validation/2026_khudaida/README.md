# 2026 Khudaida Analysis

Electrolyte LLE paper-validation workflow for Khudaida et al. 2026 water + ethanol + isobutanol + NaCl salting-out data.

Scope:

- Non-reactive electrolyte LLE only.
- Public package route: `mix.equilibrium(kind="electrolyte_lle", ...)`.
- Parameter dataset: `2026_Khudaida`, with paper Tables 5-7 and Born SSM+DS options retained under `shared/source/`.
- Figures 1-9 and Tables 9-10 have figure-owned workflows; Supporting Information Figures S2-S3 are retained as three-panel workflows covering subfigures a-c.
- Supporting Information Tables S1-S4 are retained as analysis-owned CSV inputs for distribution/separation-factor and eNRTL comparison checks.

Entry point:

```powershell
uv run python analyses\paper_validation\2026_khudaida\scripts\run_all.py
```

Generated figure assets are written under each `figures/<figure_id>/results/` folder. The retained CSVs snapshot the exact plotted/source data used by each figure workflow.

Figures 2-7 have a separate live-Ipopt diagnostic entry point that reads the figure-owned digitized feed files and writes diagnostics without modifying the retained plot caches:

```powershell
uv run python analyses\paper_validation\2026_khudaida\scripts\diagnose_figures_2_7_live_ipopt.py
```

Diagnostics are written under `diagnostics/figures_2_7_live_ipopt/`. The script records the exact `figures/figure_N/source/feed_compositions_digitized.csv` row used for each solve and only reads existing `results/data/model_tielines.csv` files for comparison.
