Development Workflow Guide
==========================

This is the operational guide for maintainers working from this source tree. Use these commands before inventing new build, test, or package workflows.

Default source-checkout sequence
--------------------------------

Start every fresh source checkout with this sequence:

.. code-block:: powershell

   uv sync --no-install-project
   uv run python scripts/dev/build_epcsaft.py
   uv run python scripts/dev/doctor.py
   uv run python scripts/dev/validate_project.py quick

This is the expected healthy baseline. It creates the uv environment, builds the in-place pybind11 ``epcsaft._core`` extension, verifies imports/tool paths and generated-output state through doctor, then runs the fast contract suite. The default test route intentionally samples representative API, native, regression, equilibrium, and workflow contracts instead of running full equilibrium/regression reproductions or generated plot production. Use ``uv run python scripts/dev/validate_project.py confidence`` before release or broad runtime claims when extra native runtime contracts should be included.
The current development and CI smoke baseline is Python 3.13, while ``pyproject.toml`` still declares package compatibility with Python ``>=3.9``.

Use ``uv run python run_pytest.py ...`` for repo validation. Direct ``uv run python -m pytest ...`` works, but the wrapper sets ``src`` on the import path and uses a per-run pytest temp directory that is safer for Windows and parallel local runs.

Command matrix

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 28 42 30

   * - Situation
     - Command
     - Use when
   * - First setup or uncertain state
     - ``uv sync --no-install-project`` then ``uv run python scripts/dev/build_epcsaft.py`` then ``uv run python scripts/dev/doctor.py``
     - Starting a fresh thread, after dependency changes, or after a failed import.
   * - Handoff validation
     - ``uv run python scripts/dev/validate_project.py confidence``
     - Before claiming repo runtime confidence. This includes doctor and the confidence slice.
   * - Fast generic validation
     - ``uv run python scripts/dev/validate_project.py quick``
     - Quick checks for Python/runtime/regression API changes plus cheap native metadata contracts.
   * - Python API work
     - ``uv run python run_pytest.py --api -q``
     - Public wrapper, parameter-template, or regression API edits.
   * - Equilibrium/speciation workflows
     - ``uv run python run_pytest.py --equilibrium-api -q``
     - Fast representative check for neutral equilibrium, electrolyte LLE, reactive speciation, reactive electrolyte bubble contracts, derivative-backend contracts, and capability reporting.
   * - Native or density/equation work
     - ``uv run python scripts/dev/build_epcsaft.py --build-only --parallel 10`` then ``uv run python run_pytest.py --runtime -q``
     - C++ iteration after ``build/dev`` is already configured.
   * - Native contract only
     - ``uv run python run_pytest.py --native -q``
     - Fast check for pressure-vs-density and contribution-map contracts.
   * - Native route metadata/result contracts
     - ``uv run python run_pytest.py --native-contracts -q``
     - Fast check for native route ``variable_model``, ``density_backend``, residual-family payloads, and Python route diagnostics. Use this instead of the full route-builder suite for architecture or metadata edits.
   * - Equilibrium route confidence
     - ``uv run python run_pytest.py --equilibrium-confidence -q -s``
     - Trusted exact-Hessian native Ipopt route ladder anchored on the hydrocarbon bubble workflow plus route diagnostics. Full paper or feed-line validation remains an explicit benchmark or analysis workflow, not pytest.
   * - Docs check
     - ``uv run python scripts/dev/validate_project.py docs``
     - Build Sphinx HTML under ``build/docs-html``.
   * - Quick method-speed check
     - ``uv run python scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_neutral_equilibrium.py --warmup 20 --repeat 100``
     - Runtime benchmark harness for neutral equilibrium; performance evidence is explicit benchmark output, not pytest collection.
   * - Neutral equilibrium benchmark
     - ``uv run python scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_neutral_equilibrium.py --warmup 20 --repeat 100``
     - Measure the current neutral state runtime guardrail without any FeOs dependency.
   * - Literature benchmark inventory
     - ``uv run python scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_literature_suite.py``
     - Review the package-owned literature benchmark scope, including which issue anchors have executable package evidence and which still require follow-up work.
   * - Package boundary
     - ``uv run python scripts/dev/build_dist.py``
     - Wheel/sdist and smoke-import validation. Isolated package builds default to serial native compilation to avoid Windows Ceres memory spikes; use ``--parallel N`` only when the machine has enough headroom.
   * - Installed/source diagnostic
     - ``uv run python -m epcsaft``
     - Confirm package and ``epcsaft._core`` paths.

Build rules
-----------

The canonical local native build command is:

.. code-block:: powershell

   uv run python scripts/dev/build_epcsaft.py

That command uses ``--profile fast`` by default: Ceres and CppAD are enabled, and Ipopt is enabled when a native install is available. On Windows, the script first honors explicit ``EPCSAFT_IPOPT_ROOT`` / ``EPCSAFT_PEP517_IPOPT_ROOT`` values and otherwise uses the local SDK default ``%USERPROFILE%\Documents\deps\ipopt-msvc`` when present. Ceres is required for native regression builds, CppAD is required for derivative-capable package builds, and Ipopt-enabled equilibrium routes require an Ipopt-enabled native build.

Wheel/editable/path installs go through the PEP 517/scikit-build backend and use the same required Ceres/CppAD policy. On Windows, the backend also uses the local Ipopt SDK default when it exists; otherwise set ``EPCSAFT_PEP517_IPOPT_ROOT`` or ``EPCSAFT_PEP517_IPOPT_DIR`` explicitly for Ipopt package builds. Repeated clean builds can still avoid rebuilding Ceres by using a prebuilt system Ceres package.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 16 22 22 40

   * - Profile
     - Native options
     - Default Windows parallelism
     - Use when
   * - ``fast``
     - Ceres ON, CppAD ON, Ipopt ON when available
     - ``4``
     - Normal source-checkout setup, C++ iteration, and most validation.
   * - ``full``
     - Ceres ON, CppAD ON, Ipopt ON when available
     - ``4``
     - Alias for the required Ceres + CppAD dependency profile.
   * - ``ipopt``
     - Ceres ON, CppAD ON, Ipopt ON
     - ``4``
     - Native Ipopt adapter development or validation with the local SDK or another native Ipopt package.

Use ``--build-only --parallel 10`` only after the CMake tree already exists. ``--build-only`` does not reconfigure profile flags; it builds whatever ``build/dev/CMakeCache.txt`` already says. Use ``--configure-only`` when you need to refresh CMake configuration without compiling. For a new ``build/dev`` tree, ``scripts/dev/build_epcsaft.py`` now prefers Ninja when ``ninja`` is available on ``PATH`` because it is usually faster than MinGW Makefiles for repeated local rebuilds. Existing CMake trees keep their original generator; doctor reports ``build_generator_recommendation`` when ``uv run python scripts/dev/build_epcsaft.py --clean --generator ninja`` is the appropriate one-time migration from an older MinGW tree.

Every native build writes ``build/dev/build_epcsaft.log`` and finishes with an ``epcsaft._core`` import check when compilation runs. Use ``uv run python scripts/dev/build_epcsaft.py --status`` when you need a non-mutating check of the configured generator, Ceres/CppAD flags, system-Ceres/Ceres_DIR state, importable ``_core`` artifacts, stale ``.ninja_lock`` state, last Ninja target, and live repo-owned build processes. This is the safest first check when an IDE run or interrupted terminal build appears hung.

For IDE run configurations, keep commands explicit instead of relying on one overloaded target:

- Native build status: ``uv run python scripts/dev/build_epcsaft.py --status``
- Native incremental build: ``uv run python scripts/dev/build_epcsaft.py --build-only --parallel 10``
- Native configure/build: ``uv run python scripts/dev/build_epcsaft.py --profile fast``
- Clean Ceres + CppAD proof: ``uv run python scripts/dev/build_epcsaft.py --clean --profile full --parallel 4``
- Native Ipopt proof with the local SDK: ``uv run python scripts/dev/build_epcsaft.py --clean --profile ipopt --ipopt-root $env:USERPROFILE\Documents\deps\ipopt-msvc``
- Native Ipopt proof with another install root: ``uv run python scripts/dev/build_epcsaft.py --clean --profile ipopt --ipopt-root C:\path\to\Ipopt``
- Native Ipopt proof with an ``IpoptConfig.cmake`` directory: ``uv run python scripts/dev/build_epcsaft.py --clean --profile ipopt --ipopt-dir C:\path\to\lib\cmake\Ipopt``

Do not use ``--clean`` for routine validation. ``uv run python scripts/dev/build_epcsaft.py --clean`` is a repair action for stale CMake state or stale/locked ``_core`` artifacts. A clean dev build deletes the reusable CMake tree, so Ceres source/configuration/build work under ``build/dev/_deps`` may run again unless you use a prebuilt system Ceres package. If Windows reports that ``_core*.pyd`` is locked, stop Python REPLs, tests, IDE run configurations, or parallel workers that imported ``epcsaft._core`` before retrying. If ``--status`` reports a stale Ninja lock, inspect the listed process ids and stop only repo-owned build processes before retrying.

If Ceres becomes part of a repeated local workflow, build or install Ceres once outside ``build/dev`` and use the system-Ceres path instead of vendoring it through ``FetchContent`` on every clean full-profile configure. The supported command shape is:

.. code-block:: powershell

   uv run python scripts/dev/build_system_ceres.py --parallel 4
   uv run python scripts/dev/build_epcsaft.py --profile full --use-system-ceres --ceres-dir C:\path\to\lib\cmake\Ceres

``--ceres-dir`` should point at the directory containing ``CeresConfig.cmake``. Ceres' own CMake documentation supports consuming either an installed Ceres package or an exported Ceres build directory through ``find_package(Ceres)`` and ``Ceres::ceres``.

The same prebuilt Ceres package can accelerate downstream path installs without changing package defaults:

.. code-block:: powershell

   $env:EPCSAFT_PEP517_CERES_DIR = "C:\path\to\lib\cmake\Ceres"
   $env:EPCSAFT_PEP517_USE_SYSTEM_CERES = "1"
   $env:EPCSAFT_PEP517_BUILD_DIR = "$PWD\.uv-cache\epcsaft-build"
   uv sync --reinstall-package epcsaft

Without those Ceres environment variables, wheel/editable/path installs still build the default Ceres-enabled package through ``FetchContent``. On Windows, Ipopt uses the local SDK default when present; otherwise set ``EPCSAFT_PEP517_IPOPT_ROOT`` or ``EPCSAFT_PEP517_IPOPT_DIR`` before installing if the package build needs Ipopt.

LaTeX and Overleaf mirror
-------------------------

``docs/latex`` is normal tracked repo content and is the source of truth for equation-heavy LaTeX files. It is not a Git submodule.

Use this once to create or validate the external Overleaf checkout:

.. code-block:: powershell

   .\scripts\docs\setup_latex_mirror.ps1

After LaTeX edits are committed or ready to publish, mirror the current ``docs/latex`` tree to Overleaf:

.. code-block:: powershell

   .\scripts\docs\sync_latex_mirror.ps1

The mirror lives at ``C:\Users\Tanner\Documents\git\LaTeX-Projects\ePC-SAFT-LaTeX`` and owns the Overleaf Git remote. The sync script copies the current LaTeX source tree and intentional top-level artifacts; generated ``docs/latex/out`` build products remain ignored in this repo.

Parallel worker safety
----------------------

The dev build tree and benchmark outputs under ``build/`` are shared disposable state. In parallel sessions, coordinate native rebuild, clean, and repair work so only one process owns the native extension at a time.

- Do not run clean or repair actions while tests, REPLs, IDE run configurations, or other workers may import ``epcsaft._core``.
- Prefer one native builder at a time for ``build/dev`` and the in-place ``_core`` extension.
- Let parallel workers run focused test slices for their lane, and reserve full build, doctor, and ``--confidence`` validation for coordinated handoff checks.
- Use explicit benchmark scripts for speed claims, for example ``uv run python scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_neutral_equilibrium.py --warmup 20 --repeat 100``. Do not route performance claims through pytest.

Project-local Git worktrees
---------------------------

Use ``scripts/dev/create_dev_worktree.ps1`` from the primary checkout instead of raw ``git worktree add`` when a contributor needs a project-local worktree under ``.worktrees/``. The helper creates ``.worktrees/<name>`` and registers the new checkout path as a Git ``safe.directory`` so future Git commands inside that worktree do not fail on Windows when the checkout is accessed by tools running under different user contexts.

.. code-block:: powershell

   .\scripts\dev\create_dev_worktree.ps1 -Name equilibrium-v3 -Branch feature/equilibrium-v3

``.worktrees/`` must stay ignored in ``.gitignore`` before using the helper. The ``safe.directory`` registration is intentionally path-specific and global to the current Windows user. Use ``-SkipSafeDirectory`` only when you plan to use per-command ``git -c safe.directory=<path> ...`` overrides instead.

Test selection rules
--------------------

Use the smallest relevant test first, then run ``uv run python scripts/dev/validate_project.py confidence`` before release, merge, or broad runtime claims. Use ``uv run python run_pytest.py --all -q`` only when you explicitly need every retained pytest contract.

Before running ``run_pytest.py``, direct ``pytest``, or any ``validate_project.py``
mode that runs pytest, read this command matrix and the test-selection rules in
this section. Also read the relevant domain documentation for the slice: for
example, read ``docs/roadmaps/unified_equilibrium_core_algorithm.md`` before
native/equilibrium route tests. If the right target is unclear, run
``uv run python run_pytest.py --list-slices`` before choosing a command.

- Python wrapper/API changes: ``uv run python run_pytest.py --api -q`` first, then ``uv run python run_pytest.py --confidence -q``.
- Native/equation changes: ``uv run python scripts/dev/build_epcsaft.py --build-only --parallel 10`` first, then ``uv run python run_pytest.py --runtime -q``, then ``uv run python run_pytest.py --confidence -q``.
- Native route metadata, result-adapter diagnostics, or pybind payload-shape changes: run ``uv run python run_pytest.py --native-contracts -q`` first. Do not run broad route-builder files under ``tests/native/equilibrium`` for these changes; the wrapper rejects those broad targets unless ``--allow-long-native-tests`` or ``EPCSAFT_ALLOW_LONG_NATIVE_TESTS=1`` is set.
- Equation traceability changes: ``uv run python scripts/docs/sync_equation_registry.py --check --strict-traceability`` then ``uv run python run_pytest.py tests/native/contracts/test_equation_registry.py -q``.
- Performance claims: run explicit benchmark scripts such as ``uv run python scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_neutral_equilibrium.py --warmup 20 --repeat 100``. Do not rely on pytest, skipped tests, or code inspection for speed claims.
- Plot asset changes: run the owning ``analyses/<category>/<short_id>/scripts`` coordinator or the figure-local ``analyses/<category>/<short_id>/figures/<figure_id>/scripts`` entrypoint, plus any targeted opt-in test under ``analyses/package_validation/package_plot_smokes/tests``, only when regenerating local plot outputs is explicitly part of the task.

- Packaging changes: ``uv run python scripts/dev/build_dist.py``. The command defaults to ``--parallel 1`` for isolated PEP 517 builds; raise it only after confirming Ceres builds are not memory-bound.

Keep generated plot assets and generated CSV workflows out of normal validation unless the task explicitly asks for them. There is no named plot validation slice; target the owning script or test file directly when plot output work is in scope.

Use ``uv run python run_pytest.py --list-slices`` when you need to inspect what each named slice runs before choosing a validation command.
The named slices and ``scripts/dev/validate_project.py`` modes are adapted from
``epcsaft.runtime.capability_evidence``. Add new executable evidence there first, then
let the CLI wrappers expose it through the existing command surfaces.

For parallel sessions, leave the default repo-local temp behavior alone unless it causes contention. When running concurrent pytest lanes, set ``EPCSAFT_PYTEST_TEMP_ROOT`` to an external temp root for the extra lanes so each run gets an isolated ``pytest-temp`` child.

Runtime speed rule
------------------

For repeated runtime calls, build ``Mixture`` and ``State`` objects once and reuse them inside hot loops. The quick profile report compares reused-state property calls against full rebuild calls and flags the ratio when rebuilds dominate runtime.

Neutral equilibrium benchmark
-----------------------------

Use the package-owned benchmark harness when the claim is specifically about neutral equilibrium throughput rather than the broader runtime profile suite.

.. code-block:: powershell

   uv run python scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_neutral_equilibrium.py --warmup 20 --repeat 100
   uv run python scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_neutral_equilibrium.py --warmup 20 --repeat 100 --json build/benchmarks/neutral_equilibrium.json
   uv run python scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_neutral_equilibrium.py --warmup 20 --repeat 100 --baseline-json build/benchmarks/neutral_equilibrium_baseline_issue43.json

The harness benchmarks these package-owned neutral cases:

- ``neutral_state``

Each case reports a deterministic fingerprint plus medians, spread metrics,
failures, and whether a neutral fast path was used. This harness does not
require FeOs and should remain the local performance guardrail for
issue-driven neutral-equilibrium work.

Literature benchmark inventory
------------------------------

Use the package-owned literature suite inventory when the question is coverage
and benchmark scope rather than runtime speed.

.. code-block:: powershell

   uv run python scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_literature_suite.py
   uv run python scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_literature_suite.py --case figiel_2025_ssm_ds_born
   uv run python scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_literature_suite.py --json build/benchmarks/literature_suite.json

The inventory reports each issue-scope literature anchor with a classification
such as ``already_supported_with_tests`` or ``blocker_requires_followup`` plus
the owning package surfaces. Use it to keep benchmark claims honest and to
avoid silently treating blocked literature routes as complete. The inventory is
kept outside pytest so paper-wide validation stays opt-in.
The JSON payload also records the registered validation lanes and pytest slices
from ``epcsaft.runtime.capability_evidence`` so benchmark inventory output can be read
against the same executable evidence registry used by the development CLIs.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Run ``uv run python scripts/dev/doctor.py`` whenever imports, tool paths, ``_core`` state, or generated-output tracking are unclear. It reports the active Python, git ref, uv/cmake/ninja paths, ``epcsaft`` import path, ``epcsaft._core`` path, required native symbol presence, generated artifact state, and the next recommended command.

If ``scripts/dev/build_epcsaft.py`` appears slow, run ``uv run python scripts/dev/build_epcsaft.py --status`` first. If the status output shows a stale Ninja lock and live repo-owned build processes, resolve those processes before retrying. If the status output is clean, check whether ``build/dev/CMakeCache.txt`` reports ``CMAKE_GENERATOR:INTERNAL=MinGW Makefiles``. A clean one-time switch to Ninja can materially reduce rebuild overhead on Windows systems where Ninja is already installed. Clean Ceres configure/builds can still take longer than incremental rebuilds; ``--build-only --parallel 10`` is the intended C++ edit loop after the tree is configured.
