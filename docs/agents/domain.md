# Domain Docs

How engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root.
- **`docs/milestones/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root. Treat it as the package-context and completion-standard milestone plan unless the active task is explicitly narrower.
- **`docs/adr/`** at the repo root. Start with `docs/adr/README.md`, then read any numbered ADRs relevant to the current topic.
- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** only if this repo later becomes multi-context and adds one.

If a needed concept is missing from `CONTEXT.md`, note the gap or use `grill-with-docs` to resolve the terminology before naming a new package concept in durable output.

## Layout

This is treated as a single-context repo:

```text
/
|-- CONTEXT.md
|-- docs/
|   `-- adr/
`-- src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When output names a domain concept in an issue title, refactor proposal, hypothesis, or test name, use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`.

If the needed concept is not in the glossary yet, either reconsider whether the language belongs in this repo or note the gap for `grill-with-docs`.

When suggesting or documenting package entrypoints, prefer the current public seams recorded in `CONTEXT.md` and the ADRs: `from epcsaft_equilibrium import Equilibrium` followed by `Equilibrium(mixture, route=..., ...).solve()` for production neutral VLE, neutral TP flash, and neutral nonassociating LLE equilibrium, canonical parameter families through `ParameterSet`, shared regression summaries through `TargetDataset.target_family_summaries()`, provider capability claims through `epcsaft.capabilities()`, and equilibrium capability claims through `epcsaft_equilibrium.capabilities()`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding it.
