**Goal:** Resolve GitHub issue #191: Prove electrolyte GFPE and HELD2.0 validation gates.

**Architecture:** Keep the work inside the owning milestone/package boundary and
use the source spec plus GitHub issue as the behavior contract. Public capability
claims should move only when the proof oracle records matching evidence.

**Tech Stack:** Python, C++/pybind11 where the issue touches native code, CMake,
CppAD/Ceres/Ipopt only when required by the issue labels, pytest, GitHub Issues.

- Source Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-30-m4-equilibrium-issue-0191-prove-electrolyte-gfpe-and-held2-0-validation-gates-plan.md`
- GitHub Issue: `https://github.com/ePC-SAFT/ePC-SAFT/issues/191`
- Milestone: `M4 - Equilibrium`
- AFK/HITL: `HITL`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Electrolyte GFPE route admission is gated by source-backed validation and postsolve certification.
- [ ] HELD2.0 diagnostics cover electrolyte-specific stability/candidate evidence.
- [ ] Capability evidence distinguishes neutral, associating, electrolyte, and reactive support.
- [ ] Docs do not claim electrolyte production support before executable evidence passes.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Preflight And Boundary Check

**Files:**
- `packages/epcsaft-equilibrium/**`
- `packages/epcsaft/tests/**`
- `tests/native/contracts/**`
- `tests/workflows/repo/**`
- `docs/superpowers/**`

- [ ] Confirm GitHub issue #191 is still `blocked` and verify blocker/design state before code changes.
- [ ] Read the source spec, issue mirror, GitHub issue, and milestone README.
- [ ] Confirm candidate file ownership and reject unrelated package or milestone scope.
- [ ] Select the smallest validation slice that proves the issue behavior.

### Task 2: Implement The Issue Slice

**Files:**
- `packages/epcsaft-equilibrium/**`
- `packages/epcsaft/tests/**`
- `tests/native/contracts/**`
- `tests/workflows/repo/**`
- `docs/superpowers/**`

- [ ] Write or identify the failing contract/test that expresses the acceptance criteria.
- [ ] Implement the smallest behavior change that satisfies the issue without fallback paths.
- [ ] Update docs, registries, source manifests, or capability evidence only when behavior changed.

### Task 3: Validate And Handoff

**Files:**
- `packages/epcsaft-equilibrium/**`
- `packages/epcsaft/tests/**`
- `tests/native/contracts/**`
- `tests/workflows/repo/**`
- `docs/superpowers/**`

- [ ] Run the proof oracle commands that apply to the changed files.
- [ ] Run `uv run python scripts/dev/validate_project.py quick` unless a narrower documented validation is sufficient and recorded.
- [ ] Prepare PR-ready evidence that closes GitHub issue #191.

## Proof Oracle

- Run focused electrolyte equilibrium tests when implemented.
- Run native contracts.
- Run docs validation.
